| PDF (Open Access) | https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-12-02/pdf/2020-26329.pdf |

**Key Content:** This Final Rule establishes the CALC (Cause, Age, Location Consistent) deaths methodology as the denominator for OPO performance metrics. CALC deaths are defined as inpatient deaths of individuals aged 75 or younger with an ICD-10-CM cause of death code consistent with organ donation. The data source is the CDC's Multiple Cause of Death (MCOD) files, which provide county-level mortality data derived from standardized death certificates.

**Key Content:** The OPTN response raises several concerns about the CALC methodology, including: (1) OPOs do not control who dies in their DSA; (2) MCOD data lacks clinical precision (e.g., no information on mechanical ventilation status); (3) significant time lag in data availability; (4) state-level variation in death certificate reporting. The OPTN recommended that CMS consider more direct and granular data sources, such as ventilated in-patient death data transmitted from hospital electronic medical records.

### [17] OPTN Deceased Donor Potential Study (2015)

| OPTN (Open Access) | https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/media/1495/ddps_final_report.pdf |

**Key Content:** The DDPS was a foundational effort to quantify the total potential for deceased organ donation in the United States. The study estimated that 35,000-40,000 potential donors exist annually, with only approximately one-fifth being realized. Critically, the study found that two-thirds of the gap between potential and actual donors occurs among individuals aged 50-75, where donation realization rates are approximately 10% compared to 50% for younger donors. This highlighted that the bottleneck was not primarily in identifying potential donors but in converting them.
