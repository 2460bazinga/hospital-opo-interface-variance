THE COORDINATION CONSTRAINT IN DECEASED ORGAN PROCUREMENT
A Causal Decomposition Analysis
======================================================================

================================================================================
IMPORTANT: TEMPORAL CONTEXT
================================================================================
This analysis uses ORCHID data from 2015-2021.

The organ procurement landscape has TRANSFORMED since then:
  - Referrals: ~180,000/year → 1,156,611/year (6.4x increase)
  - DCD share: ~20-25% → 43%
  - NRP and advanced perfusion have expanded candidacy

INTERPRETATION GUIDANCE:
  ✓ VALID: Mechanisms demonstrated (coordination variance, IV causality)
  ✓ VALID: Percentage-based findings (within ORCHID sample)
  ✗ INVALID: Absolute extrapolations to 2024+
  ? REQUIRES VALIDATION: Whether magnitudes persist in current landscape

PATHWAY STRATIFICATION (DBD vs DCD)
======================================================================
NOTE: DCD landscape has transformed since ORCHID era (20% → 43% share)

DBD:
  N: 10,705
  Approach rate: 94.4%
  Shapley - Sorting: 12.9%, Auth: 56.5%
  Bottleneck: Authorization

DCD:
  N: 77,532
  Approach rate: 9.6%
  Shapley - Sorting: 50.2%, Auth: 25.6%
  Bottleneck: Sorting
  ⚠️  DCD landscape has transformed since 2015-2021

VARIANCE DECOMPOSITION
======================================================================

Hospitals analyzed: 312
ICC: 0.348
  Between-OPO: 35%
  Within-OPO:  65%

Avg within-OPO gap: 42.9%

→ INTERPRETATION: Majority of variance is WITHIN-OPO,
  indicating coordination constraints at hospital-OPO interface.

======================================================================
FALSIFICATION TEST

Correlation (hosp approach rate, TX rate): 0.121
Regression coef: 0.0162 (p=0.656)

INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ANALYSIS

OPO-Level IV
  Instrument: OPO mean approach rate
  N: 88,237
  First-stage F: 1273.1 (Strong)
  OLS: 0.2288 (SE: 0.0024)
  IV:  0.2297 (SE: 0.0212)
  95% CI: (0.1882, 0.2713)

Hospital-Level IV (within OPO)
  Instrument: Hospital approach rate + OPO FE
  N: 87,284
  First-stage F: 575.0 (Strong)
  OLS: 0.2317 (SE: 0.0024)
  IV:  0.1991 (SE: 0.0312)

======================================================================
COUNTERFACTUAL ANALYSIS
======================================================================
⚠️  These estimates apply ONLY to ORCHID sample (2015-2021)
⚠️  Do NOT extrapolate to present day

Primary: All OPOs at best-performer approach rate
  SCOPE: ORCHID sample 2015-2021 ONLY
  Current rate: 19.9% → Target: 26.3%
  Additional TX in sample: 1,117
  Improvement: 13.4%

  ⚠️  CAVEAT: NOT extrapolatable to 2024+. Field has transformed (6.4x referral growth, DCD expansion, NRP adoption).

======================================================================
TEMPORAL CONTEXT: HOW THE FIELD HAS CHANGED
======================================================================

ORCHID Era (2015-2021):
  - ~19,000 referrals/year (6 OPOs)
  - ~180,000 extrapolated national
  - DCD share: ~20%

Current (2024):
  - 1,156,611 referrals/year
  - Growth factor: 6.4x
  - DCD share: 43%

Key changes since ORCHID:
  -   • NRP (Normothermic Regional Perfusion) adoption
  • Advanced perfusion technologies
  • Expanded DCD criteria
  • Hospital partnerships and referral protocols

⚠️  Absolute numbers from ORCHID should NOT be extrapolated to present


======================================================================
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
======================================================================

WHAT THIS ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES (valid):

1. SHAPLEY DECOMPOSITION
   Sorting accounts for 63.8% of loss
   (95% CI: 63.3-64.3%)
   
2. COORDINATION CONSTRAINT MECHANISM
   ICC = 0.348 → 65% of variance is WITHIN-OPO
   Same OPO treats different hospitals very differently
   
3. CAUSAL EFFECT (IV)
   Each approach → 19.9% TX probability
   (95% CI: 13.8-26.0%)
   First-stage F = 575 (strong instrument)
   
4. NO ADVERSE SELECTION
   High-approach hospitals do NOT have worse outcomes
   → Coordination constraint, not selection bias

5. WITHIN-SAMPLE COUNTERFACTUAL
   In ORCHID (2015-2021): ~13% improvement possible
   ⚠️  NOT extrapolatable to 2024+

WHAT THIS ANALYSIS DOES NOT CLAIM:
   ✗ Specific number of donors "lost" nationally in 2024
   ✗ That ORCHID-era magnitudes persist today
   ✗ That DCD findings apply to current DCD landscape

CONCLUSION:
   Coordination infrastructure is a demonstrated mechanism of donor loss.
   The STRUCTURAL finding—hospital-OPO variance—is likely to persist,
   though absolute magnitudes require contemporary validation.
