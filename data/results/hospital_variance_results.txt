OPO-HOSPITAL PERFORMANCE GAPS
======================================================================
OPO-Hospital pairs with 30+ referrals: 287

OPO1 (71 hospitals):
  Best: 41.1%, Worst: 4.0%, Gap: 37.1%
  If all at best: +3490 approaches

OPO2 (40 hospitals):
  Best: 40.7%, Worst: 0.0%, Gap: 40.7%
  If all at best: +2802 approaches

OPO3 (18 hospitals):
  Best: 33.8%, Worst: 4.0%, Gap: 29.8%
  If all at best: +1624 approaches

OPO4 (85 hospitals):
  Best: 42.9%, Worst: 2.0%, Gap: 40.9%
  If all at best: +4498 approaches

OPO5 (36 hospitals):
  Best: 59.1%, Worst: 7.7%, Gap: 51.4%
  If all at best: +3566 approaches

OPO6 (37 hospitals):
  Best: 30.1%, Worst: 1.4%, Gap: 28.7%
  If all at best: +2297 approaches

--- SUMMARY ---
Average within-OPO gap: 38.1%
Total missed approaches: 18,279

======================================================================
OUTCOME TEST: Do high-approach hospitals have worse conversion?
======================================================================
Approached patients: 17,453

Corr(hosp approach rate, tx rate|approached): 0.121

Regression: tx ~ hosp_approach_rate + controls
  Coef: 0.0162, p=0.6559
  -> No evidence of adverse selection at high-approach hospitals

======================================================================
HOSPITAL-LEVEL IV (within OPO)
======================================================================
N: 87,195

First-stage F: 589.5 (STRONG)
OLS: 0.2319
IV:  0.2080 (SE=0.0308)
95% CI: (0.1477, 0.2683)

======================================================================
CONCLUSIONS
======================================================================

1. VARIANCE DECOMPOSITION
   ICC = 0.348
   65% of variance is WITHIN-OPO (between hospitals)
   -> Same OPO treats hospitals very differently

2. WITHIN-OPO GAPS
   Average gap (best vs worst hospital): 38.1%
   Total missed approaches: 18,279

3. OUTCOME TEST
   High-approach hospitals do NOT have worse outcomes
   -> Not selection bias, real coordination constraint

4. HOSPITAL IV (within OPO)
   F-stat: 589.5
   IV estimate: 0.2080
   -> Causal effect confirmed at hospital level

BOTTOM LINE:
The sorting loss is a COORDINATION problem at the hospital-OPO interface.
Variance WITHIN OPOs (across hospitals) is substantial.
This cannot be explained by OPO policy alone - it's relationship-specific.
